# Experiments in Performance Engineering

Hello, my name is Josh, and I am endlessly fascinated with making distributed systems fast. 

I have an academic background in network engineering that gives me a strong understanding of networking, internet protocols, and performance evaluation. Quite a few of my semester projects in grad school involved messing with how Linux does networking and measuring the fallout.

In my day job, I troubleshoot performance issues in a complex multi-vendor, multi-stack environment. And on the side, I help people learn Wireshark. Sometimes I even perform experiments in my lab that have the potential to shake the foundations of modern networking (or at least that's what I like to tell myself).

My goal with this site is to publish Wireshark training guides and also formalize my thinking on the weird, esoteric ideas that alway seem to be running through my head.
